## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive analysis of daily petrol and diesel prices** across all districts in Kerala from **January 1, 2024, to April 30, 2025**. It explores trends, detects anomalies, clusters districts based on fuel price behavior, and forecasts future prices using advanced **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** models.

> 🔧 **Tools Used:** SQL, Python, Power BI, Streamlit, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** Live internship data from public fuel website (GoodReturns)  
- **Time Period:** 01-01-2024 to 30-04-2025  
- **Records:** 13,608+  
- **Granularity:** Daily prices for 14 districts in Kerala  
- **Key Columns:**
